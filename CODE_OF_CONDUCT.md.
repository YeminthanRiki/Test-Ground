# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

Our team comprises diverse individuals with varied experiences, including software engineers, scrum masters, and product owners. In order to foster a collaborative and productive work environment, it is imperative that each team member contributes positively, shows respect, and follows the principles outlined in this Code of Conduct.

## Harassment-Free Environment

1. Respectful Communication: Team members must communicate in a respectful manner, avoiding any form of physical, mental, or verbal harassment.

2. Conflict Resolution: Disagreements and arguments are inevitable, but team members are expected to handle them professionally. Personal attacks and offensive behavior are strictly prohibited. The scrum master has the authority to intervene and address such situations promptly.

3. Reporting Mechanism: If a team member experiences harassment, they are encouraged to report it to the scrum master. The scrum master is responsible for addressing both the victim's concerns and taking appropriate action against the perpetrator.

4. Consequences: Depending on the severity of the offense, actions may include reporting to the module teaching team, suspension, or expulsion from the project.

## Commitment to Teamwork

1. Active Participation: Each team member is expected to actively participate in project-related activities. Collaborative efforts are crucial for project success.

2. Punctuality: Being punctual for team meetings and adhering to project timelines is essential. Chronic lateness or unexplained absences can impact the team's efficiency and may result in marks deduction.

3. Assigned Work Completion: Meeting project milestones and completing assigned tasks on time is mandatory. Failure to do so without a valid reason may lead to marks deduction.

## DevOps Team Responsibilities

1. Continuous Delivery: As a DevOps team, our goal is to achieve continuous delivery, covering development, integration, testing, monitoring, feedback, deployment, and operation. Every team member plays a vital role in these processes.

2. Interdependence: Team members rely on each other to successfully complete the project. Non-participation can impede progress and affect overall project outcomes.

## Enforcement and Review

This Code of Conduct will be enforced by the scrum master, who will address violations promptly. Periodic reviews will be conducted to ensure adherence and to make any necessary updates. Team members are encouraged to provide feedback to improve the effectiveness of this Code of Conduct.

By adhering to these standards, we can create a positive and inclusive work environment, fostering collaboration and ensuring the successful completion of our project.
